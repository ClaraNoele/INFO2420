    <h2>Questions:</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>What was your first impression of this site?</li>

        <li>How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links on the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?)</li>
        
        <li>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?</li>
        
        <li>Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from it? Why?</li>
        
        <li>How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time reasonable?</li>
        
        <li>Was the text color and size readable? If a background color or image was used, did it enhance or detract from the site?</li>
        
        <li>Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was the navigation well done?</li>
        
        <li>Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all the pages?</li>
        
        <li>How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)?</li>
        
        <li>What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?</li>

    <h2>Website Critique - Jami Lin</h2>
    <h4><a href="http://www.jamilin.com">http://www.jamilin.com/</a></h4>
    
    <ol>
        <li>On first look, my impression is there is too much color and little contrast. It is organized but no very well.</li>
        
        <li>In terms of flow of information, there are links all along the top and placed at the bottom middle of the page.</li>
        
        <li>The site structure makes little to no sense. It has columns, yet it feels out of place and the top banner is poorly spaced out.</li>
        
        <li>The graphics of the site retract from it heavily. There are picture at the top then within the columns mentioned previously. The images are uneven in spacing and feel cramped.</li>
        
        <li>The home page loaded fairly quickly. It may have been my internet but I had probably a 6 second load the first time. Upon reloading it took a matter of milliseconds.</li>
        
        <li>The text color is readable in some locations and not others. It is inconsistent. The text is either black or white, and the background color is white except for the navigation bar or top graphic.</li>
        
        <li>There is a navigation bar. However, the navigation quality is lacking. There are also stray links above the images and below several paragraphs of text that are poorly placed.</li>
        
        <li>The home page color scheme does not match any other pages. The color scheme for the main page is unique to the main page and only the main page. Each site attached via links has its own design.</li>
        
        <li>The site responds to change in window size. Strangely, it zooms in on text and compresses in the side making the columsn turn into a longer page of one column. The top graphic shrinks and the navigation bar compresses.</li>
        
        <li>It offers several services to include: Feng Shui House organization, Deaging skin care, and chakra work. ALthough the site seems to be the opposite of these or cause you to feel older from how long it takes to figure what things are. You will probably need these things after visiting the site.</li>
